# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Fixed git symbolic-ref error that prevented the action from working in GitHub Actions environments ([#3](https://github.com/synctree/releasebot/issues/3))
  - Replaced problematic `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` command with robust fallback mechanism
  - Added graceful handling when symbolic reference is not available (common in GitHub Actions checkout)
  - Implemented safe default branch detection with fallback to 'main' branch
  - Improved error handling and debugging for git repository validation

### Technical Details

The issue occurred because GitHub Actions' `actions/checkout` does not automatically set up the symbolic reference `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` that points to the default branch. The previous implementation assumed this reference would always exist, causing the action to fail during repository validation.

**Before (problematic code):**
```typescript
const defaultBranch = this.executeGitCommand('symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD')
  .replace('refs/remotes/origin/', '')
  .trim();
```

**After (robust fix):**
```typescript
let defaultBranch = 'main'; // Safe fallback
try {
  // Try to get the current branch if available
  const currentBranch = this.executeGitCommand('rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').trim();
  if (currentBranch !== '' && currentBranch !== 'HEAD') {
    defaultBranch = currentBranch;
  }
} catch {
  // If we can't get current branch, stick with 'main' fallback
  core.debug('Could not determine current branch, using "main" as default');
}
```

### Impact

- ‚úÖ The action now works properly in standard GitHub Actions workflows
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes - existing workflows will continue to work
- ‚úÖ Improved reliability across different git repository configurations
- ‚úÖ Better debugging information when git operations fail

### Upgrade Instructions

No action required from users. Simply update your workflow to use `synctree/releasebot@v1.0.1` or `synctree/releasebot@v1` to get the fix automatically.

**Example workflow update:**
```yaml
- uses: synctree/releasebot@v1.0.1  # or @v1
  with:
    feature-branch: 'develop'
    main-branch: 'main'
    versioning-strategy: 'hybrid'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```
