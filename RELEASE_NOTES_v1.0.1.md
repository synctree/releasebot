# GitHub Release Notes for v1.0.1

## Title: v1.0.1 - GitHub Actions Compatibility Fix

## Release Type: Release (not pre-release)

## Tag: v1.0.1 (already exists)

## Release Notes:

This release fixes a critical compatibility issue that prevented the AI Release Tool from working in GitHub Actions environments.

## üêõ Bug Fix

**Fixed GitHub Actions Compatibility Issue** ([#3](https://github.com/synctree/releasebot/issues/3))

The action was failing in GitHub Actions environments with the error:
```
Error: Failed to analyze repository changes: Repository validation failed: Git command failed: symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
```

### What was the problem?

GitHub Actions' `actions/checkout` doesn't automatically set up the symbolic reference `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` that points to the default branch. Our previous implementation assumed this reference would always exist, causing the action to crash during repository validation.

### What was fixed?

- ‚úÖ Replaced problematic `git symbolic-ref` command with robust fallback mechanism
- ‚úÖ Added graceful handling when symbolic reference is not available
- ‚úÖ Implemented safe default branch detection with fallback to 'main' branch  
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and debugging for git repository validation

### Technical Details

**Before (problematic):**
```typescript
const defaultBranch = this.executeGitCommand('symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD')
  .replace('refs/remotes/origin/', '')
  .trim();
```

**After (robust fix):**
```typescript
let defaultBranch = 'main'; // Safe fallback
try {
  const currentBranch = this.executeGitCommand('rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').trim();
  if (currentBranch !== '' && currentBranch !== 'HEAD') {
    defaultBranch = currentBranch;
  }
} catch {
  core.debug('Could not determine current branch, using "main" as default');
}
```

## üöÄ Impact

- **‚úÖ Works in GitHub Actions**: The action now functions properly in standard GitHub Actions workflows
- **‚úÖ No Breaking Changes**: Existing workflows continue to work without modification
- **‚úÖ Better Reliability**: Improved handling across different git repository configurations
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Debugging**: Better error messages when git operations fail

## üì¶ Upgrade Instructions

**No action required!** Simply update your workflow to use the latest version:

```yaml
- uses: synctree/releasebot@v1.0.1  # or @v1 for latest
  with:
    feature-branch: 'develop'
    main-branch: 'main'
    versioning-strategy: 'hybrid'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```
